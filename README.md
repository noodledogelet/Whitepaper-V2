# Whitepaper-V2

So look, if you read V1 of the whitepaper, you should know that I am absolutely opposed to the idea of attempting to apply real world utility on a shitcoin. However, it seems that the community is very interested into turning this into more than just a shitcoin (yes, I know, the horror).

The term 'Noodle Doge' was derived from the colloquial nickname for greyhounds - Noodle Horse, since they're like skinny horses. We did have a bit of a tough time deciding on the name of the coin, but we didn't want people to get confused so we went with Noodle Doge. 

As such, the team has come up with a few ideas to enhance the tokenomics of the $NOODLE coin. 

I think I should point out that makes Noodle Doge unique is that we are starting out first with a very strong and supportive Chinese community. Our Chinese comrades are super excited for the project and those who have stayed with us through the troubles are committed to growing the project into something real, even if it isn't the next Shib or Doge kind of moonshot. It really is quite heartening and rare that we have such a selfless community that's willing to work so hard to promote us in various Chinese groups even when the chart looks like sh1t. Our graphics, posters and even our contract code was done by the Chinese community. 

As such, we will be donating proceeds from our marketing wallet (5% of every transaction goes towards the marketing wallet) and focusing on animal charities, especially greyhound rescue efforts. Greyhound racing is an abhorrent sport that should be stopped. Not only is it dangerous for the dogs, who are at risk of being severely injured because of the rigorous training, greyhounds in the industry are often kept in terrible conditions.They spend most of their lives in warehouse-style kennels, or are kept outdoors in dirt pens with no heating or air-conditioning. Fleas, ticks and internal parasites are a common condition among racing dogs. 

What's worse is that racing greyhounds are usually retired anytime from 18 months to 5 years old - either because they become injured, or are deemed unfit to race profitably. Only a small group of greyhouns manage to be rescued while the rest are euthanised or returned to breeding facilities to serve as breeding stock. Greyhound rescue efforts are usually independent organisations that depend on donations from samaritans. We hope that the Noodle Doge project can raise awareness about greyhounds and we'll be able to protect this special lovely breed of dogs better. 

Further, because of the close community bond built through the Noodle Doge project, we will also be starting an online e-commerce platform where $NOODLE can be used for payment. 5% of transaction proceeds will go towards our charity efforts, while the other 5% will be burned to ensure that $NOODLE is a deflationary currency that will only become more valuable with time. 

Noodle Doge is the first meme token project based on greyhounds, and we hope that through this project we can raise awareness for their plight.
